# Hiphops flows

This folder is for flows that can be vendored into a hiphops project and re-used

Structure should be

```
/flows
   /my_flow_name
      main.hops
      someworker.work.(ts|js)
      README.md
```

The `README.md` should explain the purpose of the flow, any requirements, and instructions on how to set it up
